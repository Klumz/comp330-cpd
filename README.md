## Weekly Reports

### Week One
This week consisted of introductions for our modules and final year project teams. I couldn't find a team that was available so I was assigned to an "Agency" team where we will be given work from people outside the university rather than working on a game. The team I am in consists of 8 BSc programmers and 8 BA students. Hopefully, I will still be able to apply my knowledge as more is revealed about our tasks.

### Week Two
Our Agency team is still a bit lost on how we'll go forward. Some of the members prefer the usual way of creating a game of our liking, while others (mostly BSc) don't seem to mind which task we're given. This week, I've mostly focused on my dissertation, the NES wiki and what game I will de-make for the NES project. I actually have a few good ideas that I think will be applicable in time. I've managed to add my own bits to the wiki, however did not manage to go too in-depth as I'm finding it difficult to understand most of the terminology and intricacies of the NES.

### Week Three
This week, we had our NES de-make presentations and I've decided to de-make Dead Space. You simply have to jump over necromorphs (the enemies) in an endless sidescroller similar to the T-rex game built inside Google Chrome. I am confident in this task, the only barrier being actually understanding Assembly as it is very different to other languages we've been using. Thankfully, Ed has provided us with his live-coding videos which will help out immensely. 


### Week Four
I was right: Assembly is, to say the least, very different. I've been struggling to understand how it flows. The live-coding videos are a tremendous help, but I do feel limited when it comes to making the game I had in mind. I will give myself enough time to work on this well before the deadline as it's apparent this isn't something that can be crammed in at the last minute. Despite this, I have made more progress than when I started so I'll consider this as positive progress. 

### Week Five
This week consisted of our comp330 Javascript application peer reviews. I am working on a simple game similar to Pong, but I somehow made it more unique by accidentally adjusting my code differently than I had in mind, which gave me an idea. In conclusion, *Russian Pong* was born. I'm way behind my dissertation work so I've been looking hard for sources to use, as well as making sure the ethics related documents are sufficient for submission. 

### Week Six
This week was reading week. I've been working on my dissertation and NES game. Nothing much to be said for this week, just focusing on getting good progress with my tasks. Current dissertation word count is too low, so I will prioritise this for now. In terms of our Agency team, after several discussions, we ended up going our own ways where the BAs will work on their own game while we BScs will continue working on the freelance tasks. 

### Week Seven
This week was the week we presented our dissertation findings. I, however, decided to send a video presentation instead as I did not feel confident with what I had. This went smoothly and, unsurprisingly, I enjoyed doing it more than presenting physically. I received great feedback, although I still feel I don't have a good grasp over my methodology. It's still a bit early to worry over it, but time goes fast. 

### Week Eight
This week, we had a peer review for our dissertation work. Feedback was informative, although I will admit there was a slight difference in student feedback and lecturer feedback which I found amusing. I've postponed other module tasks to increase my dissertation word count, as it is *still* lacking despite me having a good amount of sources. My issue is synergising them which is what takes up most of my time.
