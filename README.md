## Weekly Reports

### Week One
This week consisted of introductions for our modules and final year project teams. I couldn't find a team that was available so I was assigned to an "Agency" team where we will be given work from people outside the university rather than working on a game. The team I am in consists of 8 BSc programmers and 8 BA students. Hopefully, I will still be able to apply my knowledge as more is revealed about our tasks.

### Week Two
Our Agency team is still a bit lost on how we'll go forward. Some of the members prefer the usual way of creating a game of our liking, while others (mostly BSc) don't seem to mind which task we're given. This week, I've mostly focused on my dissertation, the NES wiki and what game I will de-make for the NES project. I actually have a few good ideas that I think will be applicable in time. I've managed to add my own bits to the wiki, however did not manage to go too in-depth as I'm finding it difficult to understand most of the terminology and intricacies of the NES.

### Week Three
This week, we had our NES de-make presentations and I've decided to de-make Dead Space. You simply have to jump over necromorphs (the enemies) in an endless sidescroller similar to the T-rex game built inside Google Chrome. I am confident in this task, the only barrier being actually understanding Assembly as it is very different to other languages we've been using. Thankfully, Ed has provided us with his live-coding videos which will help out immensely. 


### Week Four
I was right: Assembly is, to say the least, very different. I've been struggling to understand how it flows. The live-coding videos are a tremendous help, but I do feel limited when it comes to making the game I had in mind. I will give myself enough time to work on this well before the deadline as it's apparent this isn't something that can be crammed in at the last minute. Despite this, I have made more progress than when I started so I'll consider this as positive progress. 

### Week Five
This week consisted of our comp330 Javascript application peer reviews. I am working on a simple game similar to Pong, but I somehow made it more unique by accidentally adjusting my code differently than I had in mind, which gave me an idea. Long story short, *Russian Pong* was born. I'm way behind my dissertation work so I've been looking hard for sources to use, as well as making sure the ethics related documents are sufficient for submission. 

### Week Six
This week was reading week. I've been working on my dissertation and NES game. Nothing much to be said for this week, just focusing on getting good progress with my tasks. Current dissertation word count is too low, so I will prioritise this for now. In terms of our Agency team, after several discussions, we ended up going our own ways where the BAs will work on their own game while we BScs will continue working on the freelance tasks. 

### Week Seven
This week was the week we presented our dissertation findings. I, however, decided to send a video presentation instead as I did not feel confident with what I had. This went smoothly and, unsurprisingly, I enjoyed doing it more than presenting physically. I received great feedback, although I still feel I don't have a good grasp over my methodology. It's still a bit early to worry over it, but time goes fast. 

### Week Eight
This week, we had a peer review for our dissertation work. Feedback was informative, although I will admit there was a slight difference in student feedback and lecturer feedback which I found amusing. I've postponed other module tasks to increase my dissertation word count, as it is *still* lacking despite me having a good amount of sources. My issue is synergising them which is what takes up most of my time.

### Week Nine
This week I've been working vigorously on my dissertation as the deadline is near. It's been a struggle, but I think the quality of what I've written is good. Quantity not so much. I've also been working on our Agency team app, specifically at how to email the relevant information that was filled in by the user to the doctor. I still need to get used to the Xamarin tool, but progress is okay. 

### Week Ten
This week I submitted my NES game which I feel neutral about. I did enough to make *some* semblance of a game, but very poorly. I think it is enough to pass, but I will admit I'm a bit disappointed over myself as I initially felt this game idea had potential. It was cool to see it actually work, but it could've been more. I will keep moving forward and learn from this. 

This week we also submitted our comp320 dissertation proposal. I ended up focusing too much on what to write and how to synergise my sources, and not enough on actually getting words down. I honestly don't know how this will turn out, but I'm hoping for the best. At the very least, this task is done with and I can focus on the other upcoming ones such as the dissertation artefact.

### Week Eleven
This week I've mostly been focusing on how to add the email functionality for our Agency team task/self-harm application. Everyone else in the group have swiftly done their parts, so I had to quickly contribute something of mine or risk facing later difficulties. I managed to add the email functionality, but unfortunately not quite the way I planned for it to work. Although, we'll be using the Unity version for the actual app that other group members worked on which seemed more complete.

### Week Twelve
This week I realised that I'll have to do more work for my dissertation later on as a result of the low word count, but for now I will have to focus on the artefact/component aspect of it. I have a good idea of how it'll be, although implementing it is another story.


## Challenges and SMART Goals:


### Staying committed to a task (Dispositional domain)
Time and time again I keep telling myself I'll do this or this to stay committed to my tasks, but it hasn't worked out. One of the suggestions I remember receiving was to get a physical calendar, which I've tried for a while but didn't end up sticking to it. Nor did a virtual one. I've recently made my own private Discord server with different channels in it for general programming, uni work, personal thoughts (similar to a journal), etc. which has worked so far for some module tasks as it is both convenient and something I'm more familiar with that I use on a daily basis. I will try this as a solution for this skill which I think will work more effectively in the long term. 


### Asking for help (Interpersonal domain)
This is a skill I struggled with last year as well. I'd like to say this has improved, but in reality it hasn't. There have been several cases where a simple issue could be solved by simply asking either my peers or lecturers online but I didn't. Even communicating with my peers have at times been difficult, e.g. saying what I'm working on for our group task or just speaking up my thoughts. I will try to do more active participation than passive where I push myself forward to talk/ask what I have in mind rather than idly observing. This is something I've struggled with most of my life, and it will have to change. I'm not sure what solution to go for specifically for this skill other than to change/adapt my mindset when necessary and read/watch videos on improving basic communication skills.


### Controlling negative emotions (Affective domain)
I often fall in a state of void which I fill with video games, or, oddly enough, by watching people/groups that have been successful with their games (interviews, presentations, etc). Although, the latter seems to be a double-edged sword because while it makes me feel envious and happy for their success, it also inspires/motivates me to learn and do my best regarding my skills for the present and future. As a result, I've decided to keep doing this but avoid getting too caught up in it, and focus on myself by writing down my feelings that emphasise a bit more on positive outcomes, as well as things I'd like to learn out of interest for future reference. A physical journal would probably be ideal for this, but as mentioned in the Interpersonal domain, using my private Discord server has worked surprisingly well due to its convenience and ease of use. 


### Writing independent code (Cognitive domain)
For most if not every module project we've had, I've been relying on lecturers or tutorials online for my code. It works out eventually, but I can't help but feel at loss as this isn't ideal in an actual work place situation nor for personal experience. To combat this, I will focus on writing my own simple (but extensive) program during my free time, e.g. after-uni hours or even holidays. I've already thought of doing this before, so now seems like a good time to start. 


### Utilising UML diagrams (Procedural domain)
Not too sure what to write here that isn't already tied to my Cognitive domain, but I think creating UML diagrams both for my personal program and other programming related areas would be beneficial for me as I've often neglected their use. Understanding this fully will make it easier for me to visualise how systems flow and in turn broaden my knowledge of this field.
