# Comp340 CPD 
## Week One - 28th January
Unsurprisingly, the week after returning from Christmas is always the tough one. This week we were introduced to comp340. I've already read the tasks beforehand so I know what to expect, although a bit worried about the game source code submission as I don't have a clear goal of what to do since I'm part of the Agency team, and most of the work has already been done. Will need to find my lecturers Michael or Gareth to discuss my role in a bit more depth. 

## Week Two - 4th February
This week we were introduced to the comp350 Algorithms & Optimisation module. Slightly worried about this one because optimising code assumes the coder already knows the ins and outs/underlying knowledge of the project's code, which I often have an issue with. I have a vague idea on how to counter this, which is to use my 2nd year game, Sol Tenebrae, as my optimisation project. This is chosen because it was made in Unreal Engine 4 which has blueprints (its own visual scripting system), a system I'm familiar with. But for now, I will focus on the research journal task due on the 12th. 

## Week Three - 11th February
This week we had a lecture on our dissertations and how to assess their quality. I should start spending more time on mine, because I've been slacking with it due to the fact that there's still a few more months left to submit it. I will start reading up on the research I will need to at least be somewhat prepped later down the line. 

## Week Four - 18th February
This week I've been working on setting up the materials I need for the comp350 blog task, especially for the peer review next week. I think I will stick with the idea of optimising my 2nd year game due to its familiarity, so I will start writing about it on my blog. Not much else this week comes to mind other than the constant stress of dissertation work needing to be done. 

## Week Five - 25th February
This week I submitted my comp350 blog for my peer review and received good introductory feedback. I learned that I need to explain in more depth what I intend to do with my project in a more technical manner. 

## Week Six - 4th March
This week was studio practice week. I utilised my time by spending it on various tasks such as my dissertation artefact, little bit of research, and my optimisation task. Not much else to say for this week.

## Week Seven - 11th March
This week was show and tell day. Although I spent most of my time focusing on my dissertation artefact. It is surprisingly enjoyable. Having to go into the mindset of players and implement features is probably my most favourite part of this module. Although I should start thinking about other tasks too, as I've been neglecting them such as the comp340 one where I need to look at a feedback generator that was assigned to me.

## Week Eight - 18th March
This week I worked on my artefact.

## Week Nine - 25th March
This week I submitted the professional practice report for comp. Regrettably, I left this task  to the last minute which resulted in me looking for professionals online from a subreddit than from actual work sites/companies. The results could have been better, but it went well overall as I got a good amount of feedback from 2-3 experts in the field. To avoid this in the future, I will be sure to ask for advice beforehand on such tasks to avoid producing subpar work. 

## Week Ten - 1st April
This week was mostly spent on artefact work. 


## Week Eleven - 8th April
This week I looked at the comp340 task I still need to do, which was the feedback generator task. I previously produced a poster for another submission for this that explained what I currently have, which doesn't really have any form of code in it as it relied on using add-ons for Google Sheets/Docs. I will have to try actually writing something similar to these add-ons, and demonstrate the more technical side of things.

## Week Twelve - 29th April
This week I noticed that I saved data collection for my dissertation very late. I've had to scramble around in the Games Studio looking for participants to play-test my artefact/game, however was rejected multiple times as a result of various deadlines this week. To counter this in the future, avoid spending too much time on refining the artefact and focus on balancing workload so I don't save everything last minute.



## Weekly Reports

C Week One
This week consisted of introductions for our modules and final year project teams. I couldn't find a team that was available so I was assigned to an "Agency" team where we will be given work from people outside the university rather than working on a game. The team I am in consists of 8 BSc programmers and 8 BA students. Hopefully, I will still be able to apply my knowledge as more is revealed about our tasks.

### Week Two
Our Agency team is still a bit lost on how we'll go forward. Some of the members prefer the usual way of creating a game of our liking, while others (mostly BSc) don't seem to mind which task we're given. This week, I've mostly focused on my dissertation, the NES wiki and what game I will de-make for the NES project. I actually have a few good ideas that I think will be applicable in time. I've managed to add my own bits to the wiki, however did not manage to go too in-depth as I'm finding it difficult to understand most of the terminology and intricacies of the NES.

### Week Three
This week, we had our NES de-make presentations and I've decided to de-make Dead Space. You simply have to jump over necromorphs (the enemies) in an endless sidescroller similar to the T-rex game built inside Google Chrome. I am confident in this task, the only barrier being actually understanding Assembly as it is very different to other languages we've been using. Thankfully, Ed has provided us with his live-coding videos which will help out immensely. 


### Week Four
I was right: Assembly is, to say the least, very different. I've been struggling to understand how it flows. The live-coding videos are a tremendous help, but I do feel limited when it comes to making the game I had in mind. I will give myself enough time to work on this well before the deadline as it's apparent this isn't something that can be crammed in at the last minute. Despite this, I have made more progress than when I started so I'll consider this as positive progress. 

### Week Five
This week consisted of our comp330 Javascript application peer reviews. I am working on a simple game similar to Pong, but I somehow made it more unique by accidentally adjusting my code differently than I had in mind, which gave me an idea. Long story short, *Russian Pong* was born. I'm way behind my dissertation work so I've been looking hard for sources to use, as well as making sure the ethics related documents are sufficient for submission. 

### Week Six
This week was reading week. I've been working on my dissertation and NES game. Nothing much to be said for this week, just focusing on getting good progress with my tasks. Current dissertation word count is too low, so I will prioritise this for now. In terms of our Agency team, after several discussions, we ended up going our own ways where the BAs will work on their own game while we BScs will continue working on the freelance tasks. 

### Week Seven
This week was the week we presented our dissertation findings. I, however, decided to send a video presentation instead as I did not feel confident with what I had. This went smoothly and, unsurprisingly, I enjoyed doing it more than presenting physically. I received great feedback, although I still feel I don't have a good grasp over my methodology. It's still a bit early to worry over it, but time goes fast. 

### Week Eight
This week, we had a peer review for our dissertation work. Feedback was informative, although I will admit there was a slight difference in student feedback and lecturer feedback which I found amusing. I've postponed other module tasks to increase my dissertation word count, as it is *still* lacking despite me having a good amount of sources. My issue is synergising them which is what takes up most of my time.

### Week Nine
This week I've been working vigorously on my dissertation as the deadline is near. It's been a struggle, but I think the quality of what I've written is good. Quantity not so much. I've also been working on our Agency team app, specifically at how to email the relevant information that was filled in by the user to the doctor. I still need to get used to the Xamarin tool, but progress is okay. 

### Week Ten
This week I submitted my NES game which I feel neutral about. I did enough to make *some* semblance of a game, but very poorly. I think it is enough to pass, but I will admit I'm a bit disappointed over myself as I initially felt this game idea had potential. It was cool to see it actually work, but it could've been more. I will keep moving forward and learn from this. 

This week we also submitted our comp320 dissertation proposal. I ended up focusing too much on what to write and how to synergise my sources, and not enough on actually getting words down. I honestly don't know how this will turn out, but I'm hoping for the best. At the very least, this task is done with and I can focus on the other upcoming ones such as the dissertation artefact.

### Week Eleven
This week I've mostly been focusing on how to add the email functionality for our Agency team task/self-harm application. Everyone else in the group have swiftly done their parts, so I had to quickly contribute something of mine or risk facing later difficulties. I managed to add the email functionality, but unfortunately not quite the way I planned for it to work. Although, we'll be using the Unity version for the actual app that other group members worked on which seemed more complete.

### Week Twelve
This week I realised that I'll have to do more work for my dissertation later on as a result of the low word count, but for now I will have to focus on the artefact/component aspect of it. I have a good idea of how it'll be, although implementing it is another story.


## Challenges and SMART Goals:


### Staying committed to a task (Dispositional domain)
Time and time again I keep telling myself I'll do this or that to stay committed to my tasks, but it hasn't worked out. One of the suggestions I remember receiving was to get a physical calendar, which I've tried for a while but didn't end up sticking to it, nor a virtual one. I've recently (and by "recently", I really mean a couple months ago) made my own private Discord server with different channels in it for general programming, uni work & deadlines, personal thoughts (similar to a journal), etc. which has worked so far for most module tasks as it is both convenient and something I'm more familiar with that I use on a daily basis. I will try this as a solution for this skill which I think will work more effectively in the long term. 


### Asking for help (Interpersonal domain)
This is a skill I struggled with last year as well. I'd like to say this has improved, but in reality it hasn't. There have been several cases where a simple issue could've been solved by simply asking either my peers or lecturers online but I didn't. Even communicating with my peers have at times been difficult, e.g. saying what I'm working on for our group task or just speaking up my thoughts. I will try to do more active participation than passive where I push myself forward to talk/ask what I have in mind rather than idly observing. This is something I've struggled with most of my life, and it will have to change. I'm not sure what solution to go for specifically for this skill other than to change/adapt my mindset when necessary and read/watch videos on improving basic communication skills.


### Controlling negative emotions (Affective domain)
I often fall in a state of void which I fill with video games, or, oddly enough, by watching people/groups that have been successful with their games (interviews, presentations, etc). Although, the latter seems to be a double-edged sword because while it makes me feel envious and happy for their success, it also inspires/motivates me to learn and try my best regarding my skills for the present and future. As a result, I've decided to keep doing this but avoid getting too caught up in it, and focus on myself by writing down my feelings that emphasise a bit more on positive outcomes, as well as things I'd like to learn out of interest for future reference. A physical journal would probably be ideal for this, but as mentioned in the Interpersonal domain, using my private Discord server has worked surprisingly well due to its convenience and ease of use. 


### Writing independent code (Cognitive domain)
For most if not every module project we've had, I've been relying on lecturers or tutorials online for my code. It works out eventually, but I can't help but feel at loss as this isn't ideal in an actual work place situation nor for personal learning. To combat this, I will focus on writing my own simple (but extensive) program during my free time, e.g. after-uni hours or even holidays. I've already thought of doing this before, so now seems like a good time to start. 


### Utilising UML diagrams (Procedural domain)
Not too sure what to write here that isn't already tied to my Cognitive domain, but I think creating UML diagrams both for my personal program and other programming related areas would be beneficial for me as I've often neglected their use. Understanding UML fully will make it easier for me to visualise how systems flow and in turn broaden my knowledge of this field.
