## Weekly Reports

### Week One
This week consisted of introductions for our modules and final year project teams. I couldn't find a team that was available so I was assigned to an "Agency" team where we will be given work from people outside the university rather than working on a game. The team I am in consists of 8 BSc programmers and 8 BA students. Hopefully, I will still be able to apply my knowledge as more is revealed about our tasks.

### Week Two
Our Agency team is still a bit lost on how we'll go forward. Some of the members prefer the usual way of creating a game of our liking, while others (mostly BSc) don't seem to mind which task we're given. This week, I've mostly focused on my dissertation, the NES wiki and what game I will de-make for the NES project. I actually have a few good ideas that I think will be applicable in time. I've managed to add my own bits to the wiki, however did not manage to go too in-depth as I'm finding it difficult to understand most of the terminology and intricacies of the NES.

### Week Three
This week, we had our NES de-make presentations and I've decided to de-make Dead Space. You simply have to jump over necromorphs (the enemies) in an endless sidescroller similar to the T-rex game built inside Google Chrome. I am confident in this task, the only barrier being actually understanding Assembly as it is very different to other languages we've been using. Thankfully, Ed has provided us with his live-coding videos which will help out immensely. 


### Week Four
I was right: Assembly is, to say the least, very different. I've been struggling to understand how it flows. The live-coding videos are a tremendous help, but I do feel limited when it comes to making the game I had in mind. I will give myself enough time to work on this well before the deadline as it's apparent this isn't something that can be crammed in at the last minute. Despite this, I have made more progress than when I started so I'll consider this as positive progress. 

### Week Five
This week consisted of our comp330 Javascript application peer reviews. I am working on a simple game similar to Pong, but I somehow made it more unique by accidentally adjusting my code differently than I had in mind, which gave me an idea. In conclusion, *Russian Pong* was born. I'm way behind my dissertation work so I've been looking hard for sources to use, as well as making sure the ethics related documents are sufficient for submission. 

### Week Six
This week was reading week. I've been working on my dissertation and NES game. Nothing much to be said for this week, just focusing on getting good progress with my tasks. Current dissertation word count is too low, so I will prioritise this for now. In terms of our Agency team, after several discussions, we ended up going our own ways where the BAs will work on their own game while we BScs will continue working on the freelance tasks. 

### Week Seven
This week was the week we presented our dissertation findings. I, however, decided to send a video presentation instead as I did not feel confident with what I had. This went smoothly and, unsurprisingly, I enjoyed doing it more than presenting physically. I received great feedback, although I still feel I don't have a good grasp over my methodology. It's still a bit early to worry over it, but time goes fast. 

### Week Eight
This week, we had a peer review for our dissertation work. Feedback was informative, although I will admit there was a slight difference in student feedback and lecturer feedback which I found amusing. I've postponed other module tasks to increase my dissertation word count, as it is *still* lacking despite me having a good amount of sources. My issue is synergising them which is what takes up most of my time.

### Week Nine
This week I've been working vigorously on my dissertation as the deadline is near. It's been a struggle, but I think the quality of what I've written is good. Quantity not so much. I've also been working on our Agency team app, specifically at how to email the relevant information that was filled in by the user to the doctor. I still need to get used to the Xamarin tool, but progress is okay. 

### Week Ten
This week I submitted my NES game which I feel neutral about. I did enough to make *some* semblance of a game, but very poorly. I think it is enough to pass, but I will admit I'm a bit disappointed over myself as I initially felt this game idea had potential. It was cool to see it actually work, but it could've been more. I will keep moving forward and learn from this. 

This week we also submitted our comp320 dissertation proposal. I ended up focusing too much on what to write and how to synergise my sources, and not enough on actually getting words down. I honestly don't know how this will turn out, but I'm hoping for the best. At the very least, this task is done with and I can focus on the other upcoming ones such as the dissertation artefact.

### Week Eleven
This week I've mostly been focusing on how to add the email functionality for our Agency team task/self-harm application. Everyone else in the group have swiftly done their parts, so I had to quickly contribute something of mine or risk facing later difficulties. I managed to add the email functionality, but unfortunately not quite the way I planned for it to work. Although, we'll be using the Unity version for the actual app that other group members worked on which seemed more complete.

### Week Twelve
This week I realised that I'll have to do more work for my dissertation later on as a result of the low word count, but for now I will have to focus on the artefact/component aspect of it. I have a good idea of how it'll be, although implementing it is another story.
